        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Hi, I'm MEKALA SUDHEESHNA, a passionate engineering student specializing in cybersecurity and software development. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Malla Reddy Engineering College For Women.
            My technical skill set includes proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, and SQL, as well as experience with web development. I also have a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and cybersecurity principles.
            
            I have completed internships at Next24Tech Company where I worked on developing secure web applications and implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics. Additionally, I participated in the VNR Designathon, where my team developed a cybersecurity solution.
            
            One of my notable projects is the development of a LOGO FORGERY application that tracks fake logos or images. I utilized React for the front end, Flask for the back end, and MongoDB for data storage. This project helped me enhance my full-stack development skills and gain practical experience with API integration.
            
            I am particularly interested in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, with a goal to develop innovative solutions that enhance digital security. I aspire to work on projects that leverage AI for cybersecurity and contribute to creating secure, self-healing systems.
            
            Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy participating in hackathons, solving puzzles, and staying updated with the latest tech trends. I am also an avid runner and enjoy exploring new trails during my free time.

                  <h2>DISC SPACE RENTAL SYSTEM</h2> 
                  <p> 
                   A disc space rental system is a software application that provides
                    decentralized and secure renting platform. It is important because
                    it tackles the challenge of managing and allocating disc space
                    effectively. By implementing this system, organisations can 
                    offer disc space for rent to users based on their specific needs.

                  <p> 
                    The goal is to develop a system that can identify and detect forged or manipulated images or logos.
                    It is important because logo forgery can lead to fraudulent activites such as miss leading 
                    advertisements, counterfeit activities. To detect logos various technologies are used such as image
                    analysis,machine learning and computer vision.

                  <p> 
                    Web Vulnerability using machine learning offers wide range of services from e-commerce to
                    social networking. They are also common target for cyber attacks due to their complexity 
                    and vast amount of sensitive information they handle. Web vulnerabilities such as SQL 
                    injection, XSS, CSRF pose significant threats to the security of web application and their uses.
